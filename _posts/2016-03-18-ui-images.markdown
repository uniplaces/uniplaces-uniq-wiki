description: "Images can and should be used directly, but lazy-load support is provided. Image lazy-loading works by have a 'lightweight' placeholder image loading by and one the target image comes into the users viewport the correct image loading is triggered. detection occurs by binding a javascript event to the scroll and using the BoundingClientRect() to detect wether the image should be shown or not.

Javascript source code can be found at lazyload.js"
