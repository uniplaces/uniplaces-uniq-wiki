# Uniplaces Internal CSS Framework/Toolkit

A mostly reasonable approach to the CSS and Sass internal toolkit we use at [Uniplaces](http://uniplaces.com).

This repo is for distribution on `bower`.
Sass/SCSS built and lightly opinionated this style and JS bundle contains basic components to make it easier to start "bootstraping" a web-application or web-site.

## Install

```shell
bower install uniq
```

or

```shell
bower install uniq --save
```

## Update

```shell
bower update uniq
```

Will update to the version present in the `bower.json` file.

## Documentation

Documentation is available in our  [wiki](https://github.com/uniplaces/uniplaces-uniq-wiki).

*Bear in mind that this framework/toolkit provides both a set of mixins as well as default global styles.*
